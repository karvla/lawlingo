The Swedish Justice Department has published a [list](https://www.regeringen.se/rapporter/2011/10/pm-20111/) of words that can be replaced to improve readability. This notebook is used to track the occurrences of these words in public judgments. This tool was used in a project by Miriam Ã–hman at Lund University.
